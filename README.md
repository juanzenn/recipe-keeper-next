## Why Recipe Keeper?
I love to cook and bake bread. One of the problems I face ** every time** I want to make something new is finding recipes. Usually **low quality, with a brick of text, ads, and a lot of garbage**, only to make a simple recipe.

**Hashnode's Hackaton** made me able to materialize this dream. I wanted people to share and gather recipes in a similar layout and comfort. That way, they don't suffer finding the ingredients or instructions.

## Technology Stack
 Creating this app wasn't easy, a month of hard work. There's a ton of possibilities to expand the idea further. The technology I choose helped with an easy, fast development.

### Next.js + TypeScript
My first framework to learn was React. Next.js takes React to the literal **next level.** Super quick to set up, an astonishing and easy folder routing, and a massive community. 

**TypeScript** worked flawlessly. It helped with a lot of the type errors you encounter in normal JavaScript development. There's no real reason to stick to Vanilla JavaScript when TypeScript makes development so easy and fast.

### TailwindCSS
Tailwind is a pleasure to use. One of the best *(if not the best)* CSS frameworks out there. The productivity of building applications and reusable pieces with Tailwind is massive. No external files, CSS-in-JS with utility classes are everything you need. 

The development process went with no problems, and thanks to their new JIT mode allows us to create even more flexible interfaces. 

### Supabase
The backend structure works on Supabase, a solution for the backend as a service. Their SDK is fantastic. They use a PostgreSQL database that allows one to build almost anything. Fast response time and unlimited API calls.

### Auth0
As a requirement for the Hackaton, Auth0 secures our users and their information. It's fast to set up and allows multiple services like Google or Github for authentication. 

Working with Auth0 was a no-brainer. I have to say they perfectly manage users. Combine with Next.js API routes, you only need to set up one file, and your Authentication system is complete, hands down fantastic service.

### Hosted and Deployed on Vercel
Vercel has been my only deployment platform in 2021. Just the best platform with the best community.

## Challenges and Features
This application works like a CMS, were you can create something similar like a blog post for recipes.

The first challenge was features. Joining quality of features plus usability was difficult. I ditched a lot of the ideas, but end up with a nice application I'm proud of. 

I work on a full month, from design in Figma to code in React.
